####<span id="edelstein"></span>Dan Edelstein
Associate Professor of French and, by courtesy, of History; Director of Undergraduate Studies, DLCL; Chair of Undergraduate Studies, French; Primary Investigator, Mapping the Republic of Letters.

Dan Edelstein works primarily on eighteenth-century France, which also serves as a convenient launching pad for raids into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as the early modern period. His first book, [*The Terror of Natural Right: Republicanism, the Cult of Nature, and the French Revolution*] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), examines how liberal natural right theories, classical republicanism, and the myth of the golden age became fused in eighteenth-century political culture, only to emerge as a violent ideology during the Terror. This book won the [2009 Oscar Kenshur Book Prize]. He recently published a second book entitled [*The Enlightenment: A Geneaology*] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, forthcoming Dec. 2010), which explores how the idea of an Enlightenment emerged in French academic circles around the 1720's. He is currently working on two book projects: first, on the concept of "counter-mythologies" during the Enlightenment and in the aftermath of the French Revolution; and second, on the "myth of the Revolution."
