###THINK 29  
**Networks: Ecological, Revolutionary, Digital**   
Dan Edelstein (French and Italian) and Deborah Gordon (Biology)  
Teaching fellows: Melanie Conroy, Elizabeth Coggeshall and Nicole Martinez-Martin

This project asks students to use the concepts of network theory to analyze key individuals and key moments in intellectual history. After choosing a major intellectual figure of the Scientific Revolution or Enlightenment (17th or 18th centuries), students determine the different networks in which that intellectual took part. In this way, we seek to understand which networks were important to making certain individuals – but also certain intellectual movements – successful, as well as to understand how these different movements depended on different networks.

List of the intellectual figures whose networks the students are mapping:  
John Adams, Robert Boyle, Nicolaus Copernicus, René Descartes, Denis Diderot, Benjamin Franklin, Galileo Galilei, Thomas Hobbes, Thomas Jefferson, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, James Madison, Montesquieu, Isaac Newton, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Voltaire, George Washington


###HISTORY 230E/330E  
**Republic Of Letters:  Knowledge And Community, 1300-1800** 
Paula Findlen And Robert Fredona

How did a "republic of letters" emerge in the Renaissance and undergo multiple transformations during the Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Enlightenment? How did knowledge, communication, and community change between the age of Renaissance humanists such as Petrarch, Machiavelli, and Erasmus, the invention of printing, the political, religious and intellectual upheavals of the seventeenth century, and the trans-Atlantic, cosmopolitan world of salons, libraries, and enlightened philosophers such as Voltaire, Gibbon, and Franklin?
